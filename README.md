## General Information

The purpose of this project was to test our knowledge based on skills learned to this point:

-JavaScript
-Import/Export/Require
-Arrow Functions
-Node.JS
-Expressions

## Technologies Used

- Git Hub
- VS Code - version 1.59.0
- Javascript
- Node.JS

## Setup

HTML/CSS and starter Script code was provided:
-ReadMe Instructions located on Git Lab Repo
-New Git Hub Repo
-Read Me file
-script.js

Once everything was setup, worked in VS Code to fully create, a professional README generator. Had to reference a bunch of material in MDN and W3schools in order to figure out structure :
-Took me a while to figure out some bugs in the Markdown
-Initially I was confused surrounding the License piece.
-Practiced leaving in experimental code lines and commenting them out. Also included comments withing the JS to explain what was going on within the functions. This was an effort to annotate some of the thought/design process

## Project Status

Project is: _Continually being updated_. As i learn more JS, react, node etc, i will update this project in an attempt to make as dynamic and informative as possible.

## Room for Improvement

I think we can further improve this by removing adding better information/more specific question.

Room for improvement:
-I need more practice with all things JS, however it hasnt been as difficult as I initially thought.

## Acknowledgements

- This readme template was based on one found [here] (https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project).
- Many thanks to everyone in class that answered all my ridiculously basic questions
